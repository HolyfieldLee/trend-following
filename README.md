# Trend following stock

📜 History

1920s–30s: The concept of trend following began in the futures markets. Traders dealing with commodities, grains, and metals noticed that prices tended to move in sustained directions, and they created strategies to simply follow these moves.

Richard Dennis & the Turtle Traders: In the early 1980s, Richard Dennis famously said, “Anyone can be a successful trader if they follow the rules.” He ran the Turtle Experiment, where he taught complete beginners a set of trend-following rules. Many of them went on to earn huge profits, making the experiment legendary.

Modern markets: Today, many CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors) and hedge funds rely on trend-following strategies across multiple asset classes—stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities.

⚙️ Methods

Trend following is built on the simple philosophy of “buy when prices rise, sell when prices fall.” Common techniques include:

Moving Average Crossover

Buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term average; sell when it crosses below.

Example: The “Golden Cross” and “Death Cross” using the 50-day and 200-day MAs.

Breakout Strategy

Buy when price breaks above a recent high (e.g., 20-day or 55-day high), sell when it breaks below a recent low.

This was the core of the Turtle Traders’ method.

Trend Indicators

Tools like ADX (Average Directional Index), MACD, or momentum indicators help measure trend strength and refine entry/exit points.

Risk Management

Trend following usually has a low win rate (around 40%), but the key is to let winners run big while cutting losses quickly.

This requires strict stop-losses, position sizing, diversification, and volatility-based adjustments.

💡 Core Philosophy

The market is unpredictable, so don’t try to forecast it.

Instead, ride the existing trend.

Keep losses small, but profits big.

👉 In short, trend following is like catching a wave: instead of predicting when the wave will form, you wait for it to appear and then ride it for as long as possible.
